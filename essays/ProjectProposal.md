## Introduction

Personal finance management is essential for making informed financial decisions, yet keeping track of income, expenses, and savings manually can be tedious. The **Budget Tracker Application** is a web-based solution that allows users to effortlessly track and visualize their financial activities. This tool aims to simplify budgeting by offering a clean, easy-to-use interface where users can categorize transactions, set savings goals, and analyze their spending patterns with insightful graphs and summaries.

By developing this application, we aim to bridge the gap between complex financial tools and user-friendly design, empowering users to take control of their finances with minimal effort.

## Project Objectives

1. **Transaction Tracking**: Enable users to add, edit, and delete income and expense entries, categorizing them by type (e.g., food, transport, utilities).
2. **Financial Overview**: Provide users with monthly summaries and trends to help monitor spending and savings habits.
3. **Data Visualization**: Display interactive charts that visualize income, expenses, and savings over time, as well as breakdowns by category.
4. **Goal Setting**: Allow users to set monthly or annual savings goals and monitor their progress.
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure a clean, intuitive design with responsive layouts across devices.

## Scope

The Budget Tracker Application will be a single-page application developed with TypeScript and JavaScript. It will use a front-end framework (React) and include data visualization features to enhance user experience.

Key functionalities:
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Simple authentication to ensure data security.
- **Dashboard**: Summarizes current financial status, including total income, expenses, and balance.
- **Transaction Management**: Provides forms for adding transactions and filtering data by date, category, or amount.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes category-based spending breakdowns, and month-over-month expense trends.
- **Goals Tracking**: Displays progress toward savings goals with visual indicators.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for strong typing and code organization.
- **Libraries**: Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization, React Router for page navigation.
- **Styling**: Bootstrap for a responsive layout and CSS for custom styles.
- **Data Management**: Use Local Storage or a mock API initially, with plans for backend integration.

### Backend (for future phases)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store user data securely.
- **Server**: Node.js and Express for API management (optional in the initial phase).

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaborative development and branching.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with TypeScript linting and automated code formatting.
- **Documentation**: GitHub Wiki for user and developer documentation.

### Deployment
- Host on Netlify or Vercel for frontend, and explore backend hosting options in later phases.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

1. **TypeScript Proficiency**: Applying types, interfaces, and generics for reliable type safety.
2. **JavaScript/ES6 Best Practices**: Writing clean, maintainable code and using arrays, functions, and modules effectively.
3. **Configuration Management**: Practicing version control through branching, merging, and pull requests.
4. **Project Planning and Documentation**: Organizing tasks into milestones and issues on GitHub, documenting progress, and creating user-level instructions.
5. **Responsive UI Design**: Building a user-friendly interface that works across different devices.

## Conclusion

The Budget Tracker Application combines financial management, data visualization, and intuitive UI design, providing users with an effective tool for managing their finances. This project aligns with key learning outcomes in TypeScript, JavaScript, configuration management, and documentation, while offering a valuable, user-centered solution for personal finance tracking.
