## Overview

**Sail Kokokahi** is a social and recreational club established in 2022 to connect individuals who share a love for recreational boat sailing. Located at Kaneohe Bay on Oahu, Hawaii, the club relies on its "Work, Play, Pay" policy to ensure every member contributes to its growth through volunteer work and social engagement. This policy requires members to fulfill an annual quota of 6 volunteer hours, tracked through activities such as:

- **Maintenance Projects or Club Clean-Up Days**: 1.5 hours per event  
- **Volunteering at Club Events**: 1 hour per event  
- **Organizing Social Activities**: 1 hour per event  

If a member fails to meet the 6-hour quota, they are billed $20 for each unfulfilled hour. The challenge for enforcing this policy lay in manually tracking volunteer hours, which often led to inaccuracies, confusion, and unfulfilled commitments.

To address these issues, our team developed the **Sail Kokokahi Volunteer Hours Management Application**, a comprehensive web application that automates the tracking of volunteer hours and billing processes while fostering greater transparency and engagement among members. This solution empowers members to monitor their contributions and allows administrators to efficiently manage and enforce the "Work, Play, Pay" policy.

## Key Features

### **1. Unified Profile and Settings Management**
I designed and implemented a unified **Profile and Settings Management Page** that allows members to:
- Update their personal information, such as their name, email, and phone number.
- Track their progress toward meeting the annual volunteer hour quota.
- Configure notification preferences for updates about billing and volunteer opportunities.

This streamlined design reduces complexity and ensures that members can manage their information in a single, user-friendly interface.

### **2. User Registration**
I developed the **Create Account Page**, which provides a simple and intuitive interface for new members to join the platform. This page allows users to:
- Enter their personal information, including their name, email, and optional phone number.
- Set a password for secure account creation.

This page ensures a smooth onboarding process for new members, encouraging greater participation in the club’s activities.

### **3. Admin Dashboard**
I contributed significantly to the **Admin Dashboard**, which provides administrators with essential tools to monitor club activity. The dashboard includes:
- A **Volunteer Hours Tracker**, displaying individual member contributions with progress bars and pending hours.  
- A **Users Table**, which summarizes approved hours, pending hours, billing amounts, and membership statuses.  
- Action buttons for approving or denying hours and managing user data.

These features give administrators a comprehensive view of the club’s engagement and simplify the process of managing billing and hour approvals.
