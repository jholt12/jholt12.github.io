Software engineering: the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software.

I find software engineering interesting and inspiring, not just in an intellectual way but with the possibility one has of creating solutions that really impact people. What has always excited me about software engineering is this merging of creativity and logic. In the near future, I would like to deepen my knowledge of the processes of developing software, create effective systems, and make it easy for me to think critically about even complex problems. This is not just a journey to equip one with technical skills but is also so formative in the ability to work collaboratively and innovate within changing landscapes of technology. 

One of my key goals is mastering how to build systems that are scalable and maintainable. As I advance more in software engineering, I would like to learn how to design systems: small systems and really big ones, using cloud computing. At the same time, I'd like to be very conversant in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, among other coding languages. Best, or no less importantly, is mastering best practices for clean, maintainable code, the best of which are test-driven development and continuous integration/continuous deployment. In doing so, I will strive to make meaningful contributions to projects for which quality and efficiency of code are supreme. 

Beyond the technical ability, I look forward to developing my collaboration and project management skills. One often works with teams in the engineering of software in order to bring ambitious ideas to life. I want to be able to lead and contribute to projects from their very first preliminary planning phases all the way through to deployment. Learning methodologies such as Agile and Scrum, with the improvement of developing better communication skills, will assist me in managing team dynamics to help build software that actually reflects the wants of its end users. Eventually, I aim to be one not just really good at coding but an architect of solutions to complex problems; one whose solutions will cut across industries and be of significance. Be it optimization of existing systems, design of new platforms, or answering currently unsolved problemsá…³I view software engineering as a route through which I can engage in meaningful work that pushes limits toward what is possible with technology.tc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
