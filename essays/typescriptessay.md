I don't know how, but here I was, an utter beginner in TypeScript, entering a new yet rather unexplored land. Programming in JavaScript and other languages, TypeScript adds a whole different flavor to the world of web development-parenthood, in particular with its uniqueness based on static typing.In this essay, I reflect on my initial impressions of TypeScript, its comparative advantages and challenges to other languages that I have employed, and my general experience learning through the ASE methodology.

TypeScript is generally regarded as an "extension" of JavaScript; in other words, it elaborates on the core of JavaScript with some added features, most noticeably static types. My first impression of working with TypeScript is that it feels like something that belongs to JavaScript, especially regarding the features of ES6 that I knew a little about in school. TypeScript adds an element of security and strength that is not native to standard JavaScript development.

One of the first things that came into view was static types. Variables in JavaScript can hold any data, and as flexible as that may be, it can also lead to some very unpredictable bugs if types are not handled with care. On the other hand, TypeScript enforces compile-time type-checking to help developers catch potential issues before they manifest in runtime.

The ability to do this alone could greatly enhance code maintainability and scalability, especially in large applications. That said, TypeScript comes with its own learning curve, even for the beginner. The additional syntax type is initially overwhelming; getting accustomed to it takes some time. However, its long-term code legibility and reliability advantage overrides this challenge.

Coming from JavaScript, I see how TypeScript bridges the gap between loosely typed JavaScript and more strictly typed languages like Java or C#. TypeScript offers JavaScript's flexibility while allowing developers to enforce stricter rules, making it versatile for both small and large projects.

TypeScript is a mix of simplicity and structure compared to most other programming languages. Dynamically typed languages like Python and JavaScript have fewer syntaxes at the start, yet the cost is often runtime due to type mismatches. On the other hand, statically typed languages, like Java, ask for more type declarations but, in turn, give much better grounds for catching those errors way more reliably. TypeScript offers the best of both worlds since, unless otherwise specified, It allows the developer to gradually introduce typing where needed.TypeScript is ideal from a software engineering point of view for constructing performant, maintainable, and scalable systems since it eventually fosters good practices like clear interface definitions by leveraging object-oriented patterns within the familiar syntax and flexibility of JavaScript.

This module introduced a concept: athletic software engineering, a completely new learning mode for me. It involves WODs, or workouts of the day, that is, time-controlled exercises in coding, with the intention of simulating the feeling of pressure experienced in the real world and boosting aptitude in coding.

The whole idea of timed exercises felt intimidating for the first time. Coding is already one of those tasks requiring focus, and including a timer amplified the pressure. But then I realized this approach makes me think critically and work efficiently. However, the WODs aren't just about solving a problem; they're about solving it within some reasonable time, which reflects the real industrial world concerning software development. This is, for sure, a burdensome but rewarding learning style: the pressure at times is stressful, yet it serves to have me practice regularly and perfect my skills. Time constraints make me write clean, concise code without overthinking the problem. 

This type of learning is enjoyable for me because it presents a competitive manner, but I'm competing against my previous performance instead of competing with others. That will lead to constant self-improvement, which goes well with my goal of becoming an aspiring software engineer. With consistent practice, I will be more comfortable with WODs. 

Learning TypeScript has opened my eyes in many ways, especially toward athletic software engineering. It provides a powerful toolset for writing clean and maintainable code for big projects. Adding static typing brings peace of mind and gives a great way to catch bugs early in the game; thus, it is not bad of a language from the perspective of software engineering. On the other hand, this athletic approach to software engineering has whisked me out of my comfort zone, but very much for good. WODS challenges me to work under pressure and develop my coding in a dynamic, fast-paced environment. The process can be stressful, but it is gratifying and enjoyable at the same time. This manner of learning will prepare me appropriately as I continue to grow as a developer. The module has finally gone a long way in deepening my knowledge of TypeScript and introducing me to a new method of practicing software engineering. I shall observe with satisfaction how TypeScript and the ASE methodology shape my development journey.
