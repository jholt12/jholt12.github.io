NYC Profile is an in-depth research paper that explores the complex urban dynamics of New York City, focusing on the critical issues of affordable housing and homelessness. Developed as part of my academic work, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the city's physical characteristics, environmental context, and socio-economic landscape.

Through detailed research, the paper examines the historical development of New York City, the impact of rising housing costs, and the challenges posed by gentrification. It also explores current efforts to address homelessness and housing affordability through policy initiatives and urban planning strategies. By analyzing these interconnected issues, the paper offers recommendations for creating a more just and sustainable urban future.

Key areas of focus include:

Urban planning and housing policy
Socio-economic disparities in New York City
Environmental sustainability and its interaction with urbanization
The roles of various stakeholders, including residents, developers, and government agencies

This project deepened my understanding of urban planning challenges and the importance of integrating economic, social, and environmental factors into comprehensive policy solutions.
